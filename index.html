       </p>
         </div>
    
        <p>Growing up in San Diego, I’ve driven past La Jolla Presbyterian many times and visited on several occasions. 
            I attended school down the road at La Jolla High School and often visited the park and tennis courts across 
            the street.</p>
    
        <p>La Jolla Presbyterian is located at 7715 Draper Ave, La Jolla, California. 
            The church has a campus with spaces for fellowship, offices, classrooms, and traditional and 
            contemporary services. The organ is in the sanctuary where traditional services are held.
            
            The sanctuary is in the shape of a cross, with a triangular arched ceiling. The majority of the pipes 
            are located on the front wall such that the pipes speak directly towards the congregation, while the 
            antiphonal pipes are located on the back wall behind the pews. The console is located at the front and 
            can be moved around to accommodate the occasion. In 1957, La Jolla Presbyterian installed a three-manual Möller 
            pipe organ, which later was replaced with a four-manual console in 1976.<sup><a href="#cite1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
            In 1998, facing air as well as mechanical issues, L.W. Blackington Associates developed a plan for the future of the 
            instrument. The current installation has 64 ranks and 3,651 individual pipes. For more information, please visit 
            <a href="https://ljpres.org/" target="_blank">La Jolla Presbyterian’s website</a>.</p>
    
        <p>I met with La Jolla Presbyterian organist, Jenny Yun, on January 13, 2025. Jenny has 20 years of experience as an 
            organist playing for Lutheran as well as Episcopal churches and has been at La Jolla Presbyterian for one 
            year.<sup><a href="#cite2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Her musical background is classical, but she has also been exposed 
            to contemporary styles, having attended a church with contemporary music growing up. Our conversation centered around 
            musical appreciation as well as the demographics of La Jolla Presbyterian. The big-ticket item we discussed: “How do 
            you share organ music with others?”</p>

        <p>At La Jolla Presbyterian, the congregation is generally older and prefers traditional music. Additionally, many 
            congregation members are retired professional musicians and are actively engaged with the organ. Jenny explained 
            that the congregation members are ready to take action with any feedback or ideas she has, as well as make 
            suggestions of their own, arrange pieces for her, and invite her to play in small groups outside of church.</p>

        <p>How does this relate back to our question? The key is exposure and appreciation. As we consider how organ music is shared, 
            we must consider where people encounter it. The organ is not a portable instrument, so listeners must go out of their way 
            to places where organs are housed. In San Diego, that means attending a church, theater, or stadium.</p>

        <p>In the context of La Jolla Presbyterian, the congregation at La Jolla Presbyterian values their organ, whether that be 
            because many of them are musicians, because they grew up in traditional churches which made use of the organ, or various 
            other reasons. Considering other places of worship in San Diego, there is a broad range from classical services with 
            choirs and organs, to small praise bands or solo instrumentalists, to full bands at mega churches. Then, it follows to 
            ask where and how are the younger generations encountering organ music? Through investigating the other organs in San Diego, 
            we can answer this question more thoroughly.</p>
    
        <h1 id="first-unitarian">First Unitarian Universalist Church</h1>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/FUU1.jpg" alt="FUU1" class="resized-img">

        <p>Images from Sam Rudenberg's phone camera.</p>
        </div>
    
        <p>In middle school, I had the opportunity to play the First Unitarian Universalist (FUU) organ in the Southern 
            California Junior Bach Festival.</p>
    
        <p> First Unitarian Universalist church is located at 298 W Arbor Dr., San Diego, California. This is in San Diego’s 
            Hillcrest neighborhood, which is considered an LGBTQ+ hub and is home to the annual pride parade and the largest 
            concentration of LGBTQ-owned businesses in the city. This is key to the identity of the staff and congregation at 
            FUU, as they pride themselves on inclusivity, supporting people of various beliefs, ages, backgrounds, and 
            identities. Learn more about Hillcrest, San Diego here: <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/citycouncil/cd3/communities/hillcrest" target="_blank">Hillcrest</a></p>

        <p> The organ at FUU is located at the front right of the sanctuary. The organist sits with their back to a wall of 
            floor to ceiling windows while the pipes are positioned to their right. The sanctuary is a semi-circle and slopes 
            downwards, positioned on the crest of a hill. The organ at FUU was originally installed by Abbott and Sieker in 
            1969. In 2002, resident organist Ken Herman contacted Marceau & Associates to update the instrument. The project 
            included a new console, façade, and tonal additions while attempting to preserve the tonal and mechanical designs 
            of the original builders.<sup><a href="#cite3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>

        <p> I met with Tómas Acosta, the organist at FUU on Sunday, January 5th, 2025. Tomas serves as the choral director as 
            well as pianist for the church and occasionally plays hymns on the organ.<sup><a href="#cite4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
            He does not strongly identify as an organist, and just recently began lessons with the past music director and organist, 
            Ken Herman. Tomas told me that the congregation at FUU thinks very highly of their organ and wished so badly to hear it played that they 
            started a fund to pay for him to take lessons, which he began a year ago.</p>

        <p> The organ at FUU is in need of care. The large glass window to the organ’s right lets sunlight in and warms up 
            the pipes, causing them to tend sharp. The stops at the console need new emblems as some of them have begun to 
            fade. Stepping back from the organ and thinking about the entire church building, FUU is located next to UCSD 
            Hillcrest Medical Campus, and as UCSD continues to grow their property, it is uncertain how this will affect the 
            future of FUU. </p>

        <p> Considering the space and those who use it, the community at FUU is what sets it apart from the 
            other locations I visited. There is a strong sense of community, and the members of the congregation are 
            welcoming to people of all identities. The congregation is mostly older, but there are many young children at 
            the services as well. In addition to solo music from Tomas, FUU is home to four different choirs: Chalice 
            Choir-a mixed community choir, Women’s choir, JUUL Tones-an acapella group, and South Bay Singers-a multicultural, 
            multigenerational group who performs more eccentric, modern tunes.<sup><a href="#cite5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> 
            It is also key to note that when singing hymns and other worship songs, FUU alternates versus of English and Spanish. </p>

        <p> The next organ we will explore serves another congregation where diversity and culture thrive. Like FUU, the 
            Immaculata serves people from diverse backgrounds, and services include singing in English, Latin and Spanish. </p>

        <h1 id="immaculata">Immaculata</h1>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="images/Immaculata2.jpg" alt="FUU1" class="resized-img">

        <p>Images from Sam Rudenberg's phone camera.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Growing up, I would see the towers of the Immaculata in the distance when driving by or playing tennis, 
            and I would occasionally visit USD’s campus where the church is located, although I had never been inside 
            the Immaculata before this visit.</p>

        <p> The Immaculata is located on University of San Diego’s campus at 5998 Alcala Park Way, San Diego, California. 
            It is not owned by the college, yet it does serve both students and community members.<sup><a href="#cite6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
            The sanctuary at the Immaculata is in the shape of a cross, with soaring rounded arched ceilings typical of 
            Catholic churches. The organ console and pipes are all located in the back balcony of the church. The organ 
            at the Immaculata is a 1973 Rudolf von Beckerath tracker organ, originally built for Mission San Luis Rey 
            Church before being moved to the Immaculata.</p>

        <p> I visited with the Immaculata’s current organist, Guadalupe Rios, on Tuesday, January 7th, 2025. Lupe 
            identifies as a pianist, composer, and choral director. Before studying music in college, he had no 
            professional training but quickly picked up necessary skills such as reading sheet music in music theory 
            courses. Lupe does not identify as a trained organist, but as I learned more about him and the Immaculata, 
            I realized this likely plays to his advantage in a variety of ways.</p>

        <p> As the organist at the Immaculata, Lupe is responsible for multiple masses throughout the day. The first mass 
            of the day is more traditional and services an older generation, while the services become more contemporary, 
            with a younger crowd as the day goes on. What effect does this have on the music Lupe selects? He shared with 
            me that the older generation enjoyed traditional organ tunes, while the younger generation preferred more 
            modern, contemporary music, thus the music shifts throughout the day. In the more contemporary services, Lupe 
            directs diverse ensembles including piano as well as a rhythm section with a full drumkit. Regardless of the 
            service, the Immaculata serves people from a variety of cultures, and they sing pieces in English, Latin, and 
            Spanish. Between the range of instrumentation and the cultural elements, this is where Lupe’s musical background 
            shines, as he can bring in his culture to perform his own arrangements and improvisations.</p>

        <p> Lupe described to me that in Catholicism, those who attend church should focus their attention on the message. 
            This doesn’t mean that the music isn’t important, as it helps progress the service, but a congregation member’s
             attention should be on worshipping God. This can be seen as Lupe is hidden from view in the balcony at the back 
             of the church. When at the console, his view is completely blocked by the pipes, so he must make use of screens 
             to time his entrances. </p>

        <p> The first thing one notices is that while it is large, it is still too small for the 
            Immaculata. The church forms the shape of a cross, with the sanctuary at the intersection point and pews extending 
            in all four directions. Lupe estimated that the organ is about a third of the size it should be to fill the space. 
            This is because the instrument was moved from Mission San Luis Rey, and wasn't intentionally designed or modified for
            the Immaculata. Organists Jared Jacobsen and Alison Luedecke describe the effect of the move:</p> 

        <p>“Unfortunately, that’s what happened at the Immaculata, where we find a transplant with a story: we used to hear 
            its modestly sized, exquisitely beautiful von Beckerath organ in what Jared Jacobsen calls perfect, jewel-box 
            acoustics at the Mission San Luis Rey; now we try to hear it in the acoustically tiled, cavernous Immaculata. 
            Because it doesn’t reach the altar from the loft, the priest would ask the organist to play a little louder, when 
            she (now he) was playing as loud as she could or ought to. Alison Luedecke, the previous resident organist there, 
            tells me that the Immaculata action (the term for what connects pipes to keys) isn’t good and needs redoing: too 
            many compromises were made when the church installed an organ that was too small for the house.”<sup><a href="#cite7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p> As I walked out to the sanctuary, the sound was weak even on full organ. The organ is a two manual, mechanical 
            action with no pistons. As the church is quite deep and tall and the floors are marble, the reverberation was very
            long. It became very apparent listening to the organ how crucial it was to time registration changes precisely 
            while the sound decayed. </p>

        <p> The Immaculata demonstrates the role of the organ in Catholic churches: the music is not the main part of mass, 
            God is. The organist is hidden and placed at the back of the church. When the musician plays the piano in the 
            sanctuary, some members of the congregation are offended.</p>

        <p> Rios has received comments that some members of his congregation prefer his arrangements and playing on the organ 
            even though it veers from a that of a classically trained organist. This plays to the idea that members of the church 
            perhaps grew up with traditional hymn tunes, but those who are newer to the church may find traditional music more 
            bland than contemporary worship tunes.</p>

        <p> There is a push and pull as the Catholic church focuses on the message and mission towards God and not the music, 
            but at the same time a musician wants to be recognized and appreciated for the work they are putting in: should 
            people clap after the postlude of a service? Up next is a church whose congregation shamelessly applauds their organist 
            as well as the the other musical guests in their space.</p>

        <p>First United Methodist Church (FUMC) is home to two organs, one in the main sanctuary and another in a small chapel. 
            Growing up in San Diego, I’ve had the opportunity to play the organ in the chapel for AGO competitions and attend 
            concerts and events in the main sanctuary.</p>

        <p>FUMC is located at 2111 Camino del Rio S, San Diego, California. Tucked up in the hills above the freeway, a white 
            exterior sets the church apart from its surroundings.</p>

        <p>Similarly to the Immaculata, FUMC’s main sanctuary is in the shape of a cross with tall, rounded ceilings. The organ 
            at FUMC is the largest in San Diego County, with pipes located at the front and back of the building creating a 
            sort of surround sound experience for those sitting in the pews. The console is located at the front right of the 
            building next to benches for the choir. Built by L.W. Blackington and Associates in 1988, the organ boasts 9 divisions, 
            108 ranks, and 6,092 pipes.<sup><a href="#cite8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>

        <p>I visited with Sarah Amos at First United Methodist Church on Tuesday, January 7th, 2025. Sarah had just recently 
            started at FUMC in November 2024.<sup><a href="#cite9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Before FUMC she had been the organist 
            for San Dieguito United Methodist Church. At first glance, the console can be very overwhelming. When I asked Sarah 
            if she felt this way, she replied that she wished it had more settings.</p>

        <p>The organ at FUMC has two sets of pipes: chancel and gallery. From the console, the organist can pull stops from one set 
            or both at the set time, effectively creating directed or surround sound in the church. Even though the floor is 
            completely carpeted apart from the sanctuary, the church interior is very deep and tall, with rounded ceilings creating 
            a very live room. Sarah said that it may be the second most live organ in San Diego, only behind Saint Paul’s Episcopal.</p>

        <p>FUMC’s congregation has a very strong sense of pride for their music program. The congregation prefers traditional music 
            for their hymns as well as prelude and postlude. In addition to the organ, there are three adult choirs which perform in 
            services and at events, as well as multiple guest performances hosted in the space each year. The congregation is very 
            engaged and eager to help with any musical initiatives Sarah and the other church directors may bring up.</p>

        <p>As Sarah was still new to her position at FUMC, she had questions about small technical ins and outs of the instrument 
            herself. This is a great example of the power of the organ, as well as the fact that two installations are rarely the 
            same.</p>

        <h1 id="all-souls">All Souls</h1>

        <div style="text-align: center;">

        <p>Images from Sam Rudenberg's phone camera.</p>
        </div>

        <p> Similarly to the chapel at FUMC, I was originally introduced to the organ at All Souls through AGO competitions.</p>

        <p> All Souls is located at 1475 Catalina Blvd, San Diego, California. The space is used for church services, organ 
            masterclasses, and San Diego Bach Collegium among other events.</p>

        <p> The instrument at All Souls was Fritts & Richard organ builder’s Opus #5.<sup><a href="#cite10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> 
            Inspired by 17th century Northern German organs, the installation was designed for clarity, strength and richness of tone. 
            The instrument was dedicated April 6th, 1986.</p>
        
        <p> I visited with Ruben Valenzuela at All Souls on Tuesday, January 7th, 2025. Before the Fritts & Richard organ, the 
            previous installation was positioned in the back balcony, and the pipes lined where in the shutters of the walls.<sup><a href="#cite11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> 
            Currently, the organ console is found on the right wall when facing the sanctuary, and all the pipes are closed in, 
            in or above the organ console, with a few pedal pipes to the console’s immediate left. As opposed to other organs 
            with pipes housed The organ is mechanical action, and it is in unequal temperament. Notable features at the console 
            are a lack of expression boxes and pistons, smaller keyboards and short keys, straight (as opposed to curved) pedals, 
            and a very decorative façade with sea creatures. Every pipe above the console is speaking excerpt for the middle pipe, 
            which is home to a sea star shaped zimbelstern.</p>

        <p> Where does this instrument perform well, and where does it struggle? The organ is designed for music dating pre-Bach. 
            20th and 21st century music can also work well, but Reuben said it is not well suited for French organ. The organ is 
            very well crafted, and the maintenance required is surprisingly low, with the only slight concerns being humidity and 
            large jumps in temperature. The church is located on the corner of an intersection and the anterior doors are glass, 
            so there is noise interference from the street, but Reuben told me they installed a new set of glass doors at the end 
            of 2024 which significantly reduces the noise interference. </p>

        <p> The organ at All Souls is colorful in tone, but what about organs colorful in physical appearance? The console of our next 
            organ is decorated with colorful stop tabs and it has a wonderful variety of sounds as well.

        <p> Prior to starting this project, I had never visited or even known about the Trinity Presbyterian organ. With the goal 
            of examining church, theater, and stadium organs, I learned of Trinity Presbyterian’s theater organ.</p>

        <p> Trinity Presbyterian is located at 3902 Kenwood Dr., Spring Valley, California. The church’s organ is used both as a 
            classical service instrument and theater organ for film screenings and concerts.</p>

        <p> Trinity Presbyterian is an A-frame church with two columns of pews leading up to the altar. The organ sits on a raised 
            platform at the front left. The original installation at the church was a combination of Wurlitzer’s Opus #0562 and 
            #1520, which came from Chicago and Madison respectively.<sup><a href="#cite12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> The two organs 
            were bought in 1955, combined and were housed in Canada as well as Sacramento before moving to Trinity Presbyterian in 1996. 
            Unfortunately, shortly after the organ was installed an arson fire destroyed the console and a considerable amount of the pipes. 
            The organ was rebuilt by the ATOS San Diego chapter and is maintained to this day.<sup><a href="#cite13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></p> 

        <p> I visited with Mike Williams and Russ Peck at Trinity Presbyterian on Thursday, January 9th, 2025. Mike Williams is a 
            member of the ATOS San Diego chapter. He wasn’t a trained organist at the time but lived in the area when the Trinity Presbyterian organ 
            was first begin installed and quickly gained interest. Today he enjoys attending events as well as learning to play the organ himself. 
            Russ Peck is a trained theater organist and is currently the house organist at the Balboa Theater, where he plays several 
            “Silent Movie Mondays” per year. Russ has also played a total of 11 seasons with the San Diego Symphony. </p> 

        <p> Entering from the back of the building, the Wurlitzer is immediately on display at the front left. The front center is 
            tiered with rows for preachers and singers, and there are two columns of pews which make up the main body of the 
            church.</p> 

        <p> All the pipes and systems are in the center back wall, with two access points: one at the back wall, and another in a 
            room to the left of the console. Russ described to me that this organ may be one of the only ones in San Diego which 
            has temperature and humidity control not only for the building, but for the pipes/percussion room specifically (the 
            temperature is kept at 70, with 40% humidity). The actual pipes and percussion are a mixture between Wurlitzer brand 
            and the Robert Morton brand.</p> 
        
        <p> The San Diego chapter of the ATOS built and maintains the organ, and Russ described to me that building theater organs 
            was not a rigorously documented process but rather done through oral/memory/apprenticeships. After the arson fire, he 
            said it took a team of about ten members roughly one to two years of work to rebuild the instrument.</p> 

        <p> The room behind the back wall houses the pipes and percussion, while the room to the left houses a Uniflex 3000 system. 
            The Uniflex system allows for the organ to save ‘infinite’ memory levels, where each user can make a profile and save 
            their own pistons.</p> 

        <p> One of the first notable differences between a church organ and theater organs is the way the expression shutters work. 
            On many theater organs, this one included, the shutters open gradually as opposed to all at once. This allows for a 
            more gradual flutter, or a slamming effect. Other features unique to theater organs include double touch, the unique 
            horseshoe console shape, colored tabs, tilted keyboards, and sound effects.</p> 

        <p> Our last stop on this organ tour brings us outdoors, where we will trade church hymns and film scores for pop tunes 
            and chants to rouse crowds. 
        </p>

        <h1 id="petco">Petco Park</h1>

        <p> **This interview was not conducted in person and the Padres were not in season at the time, so I did not take any photos personally.
            Please visit Bobby Cressey's social media for some behind the scenes photographs and videos.**  
        </p> 

        <p> In addition to being a musician, I identify as an athlete. Growing up, these two identities intertwined as I attended 
            sporting events such as baseball games at Petco Park with my parents, but also with my middle school as we sang the national 
            anthem with choirs across the city. As I look to return to San Diego after graduating, I plan to continue to pursue music and 
            tie all my interests together, which leads us to stadium organ. Connecting with organist Bobby Cressey who plays stadium organ, 
            I hoped to get a better idea of how stadium organ differs, what the role entails, and his path as a musician.</p>

        <p> Petco Park is located at 100 Park Boulevard, San Diego, California. The venue serves as the home for the Padres baseball team as 
            well as various concerts and events. A portable organ is attached to the audio system and used at baseball games. </p>

        <p> The stadium was built in 2004 with a total capacity of 42,000.<sup><a href="#cite14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> The stadium was designed to incorporate the San Diego lifestyle; as 
            opposed to east coast brick ball parks, the designers used stucco and sandstone to mimic the land and blue seats to mirror the sea. 
            An open-bowl design angles fans towards the pitcher and home plate. Until 2010, the team did not have a live organist, but presently 
            fans can find the portable organ right alongside them in the stands.</p>
            
        <p> In comparison to the other interviews which took place in person, I connected with Bobby Cressey over a phone call. Bobby’s music 
            journey began with classical music as well as jazz, playing the keys.<sup><a href="#cite15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> He had no church organ experience, yet in his mid 20s he was 
            introduced to the Hammond. In 2010, the Padres were looking for a stadium organist; Bobby pitched himself and landed the job.</p>

        <p> I asked Bobby to tell me more about why he was originally interested in the role. The key ingredients: his jazz and pop background and 
            love for baseball. So, what makes stadium organ different than playing for a church or theater and what specific skills does a stadium 
            organist need on the job? Bobby explained that a stadium organist not only needs to know their music but have excellent people skills 
            and be adaptable.</p>

        <p> For repertoire, Bobby uses lead sheets as well as composes his own arrangements for a wide variety of purposes and genres. For example, 
            at the beginning of games he has time to play a medley with pieces from 1900s to today, whereas in between plays he may throw in a 
            short charge sequence to rally the crowd. Many of the tunes played feature clear bass lines with off beats in the left hand and melody 
            in the right, comparable to the style of some theater organ pieces. During games, Bobby is constantly in communication with a DJ as 
            well as game managers to coordinate when to play.</p>

        <p> So how do stadium organs differ physically from church and theater organs? While stadium organ installations vary in many ways, one 
            thing is certainly constant: with very few exceptions such as the Chicago Barton Organ and Atlantic City Hall, stadium organs are digital 
            organs as opposed to pipe organs. The current organ at Petco Park is a Hammond SKX. It’s an all-electric, two manual with MIDI pedals 
            encased in an old organ console. The other thing to consider is the acoustics of the space, as many stadiums are outdoors or in large 
            indoor arenas. In order to combat sound interference from the city sounds and fan’s stadium organists often wear headphones to communicate 
            with game managers and to be able to hear their own playing. 
        </p>

        <p> This concludes the journey through San Diego organs for now. Please visit the About tab on the website to learn more about the project.</p>

        <p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

        <p> San Diego born Sam Rudenberg is a soon to be graduate of Grinnell College in Iowa, where he studies Music, 
            Computer Science, and Statistics, while competing on the tennis team and participating in music
            on campus.</p>

        <p>He was first introduced to the organ in elementary school, beginning lessons in third grade at St. Paul's 
            Lutheran Church and School in San Diego. Growing up, he had opportunities to play a variety of different 
            organ installations in recitals, church services, and competitions such as the AGO scholarships and Junior 
            Bach Festival.</p>

        <p>After high school, he moved to Grinnell, Iowa for college and continued to study the organ, playing studio 
            recitals as well as serving as a substitute for local churches. While in college, he has found great joy in 
            sharing the instrument with others; when he introduces friends to the organ, the questions they ask inspire 
            him to further his knowledge of the instrument.</p>
            
        <p>Thinking ahead for life after undergrad, his goal was to design a project which built on his knowledge, 
            experiences, and connections in both music and technology in Grinnell as well as San Diego. He hopes to pursue 
            a career in tech, while continuing to play music for church services, and perhaps break into theater and/or 
            stadium organ. He recognize all the opportunities he has been given, and hopes this project will be a way of 
            giving back to the organ community, as well as to introduce the instrument to a wider audience.</p>

        <p><strong>Mapping San Diego Organs</strong></p>

        <p> This project consists of a three-pronged output including a long version paper, magazine submission, and this website.
            The paper contains a literature review, justification for "Why San Diego", an overview of the types of organs, 
            individual analysis and interviews of San Diego organs and their organists, and future directions. 

            The full length paper can be accessed here: <a href="MappingSanDiegoOrgans.pdf" download>Mapping San Diego Organs: Church, Theater and Stadium</a>
            
        </p>

        <p> This website was designed to support the paper, providing visuals of each organ and a map to situate each installation 
            relative to the others.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

        <p> From church services to symphonies, ballparks to pavilions, the organ is an integral part 
            of San Diego life. The American Guild of Organists San Diego Chapter recognizes 21 organs in 
            the area, including Copley Symphony Hall, Spreckels Organ Pavilion, and St. Paul’s Lutheran
            Church among others. Organs can also be found in sports settings, such as Petco Park, home of
            the San Diego Padres. How did these organs find their way into churches, parks, and sports
            venues, and what impact do they have on the city of San Diego?</p>

        <p> In early January 2025, I set out to interview San Diego organists and visit the organs they play, 
            specifically targeting at least one of each type of organ (church/theater/stadium).

            From my visits, I was left with several overarching themes: 

            <ul>
            <li>How many musicians who play the organ identify as organists?</li>
            <li>How do audiences differ across the three types of organs? </li>
            <li>How is the organ used as a tool to bring people of different backgrounds together? </li>
            <li>To what degree is organ music intertwined with the culture of San Diegans? </li>
            </ul>
            
            What will the future of organs look like in San Diego? Throughout the interviews 
            I conducted, one thing remained constant: organ is greatly appreciated by the San Diego community, yet it
            will take work to keep the pipes sounding. </p>
