        <h1 id="la-jolla-presbyterian">La Jolla Presbyterian</h3>
    
        <p>Growing up in San Diego, I’ve driven past La Jolla Presbyterian many times and visited on several occasions. 
            I attended school down the road at La Jolla High School and often visited the park and tennis courts across 
            the street.</p>
    
        <p>La Jolla Presbyterian is located at <strong>7715 Draper Ave, La Jolla, California</strong>. 
            The church has a campus with spaces for fellowship, offices, classrooms, and traditional and 
            contemporary services. The organ is in the sanctuary where traditional services are held.</p>

        <p>The sanctuary is in the shape of a cross, with a triangular arched ceiling. The majority of the pipes 
            are located on the front wall such that the pipes speak directly towards the congregation, while the 
            antiphonal pipes are located on the back wall behind the pews. The console is located at the front and 
            can be moved around to accommodate the occasion. In 1957, La Jolla Presbyterian installed a three-manual Möller 
            pipe organ, which later was replaced with a four-manual console in 1976. In 1998, facing air as well as mechanical 
            issues, L.W. Blackington Associates developed a plan for the future of the instrument. The current installation has 
            64 ranks and 3,651 individual pipes. For more information, please visit 
            <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">La Jolla Presbyterian’s website</a>.</p>
    
        <p>I met with La Jolla Presbyterian organist, Jenny Yun, on January 13, 2025. Jenny has 20 years of experience as an 
            organist playing for Lutheran as well as Episcopal churches and has been at La Jolla Presbyterian for one year. Her 
            musical background is classical, but she has also been exposed to contemporary styles, having attended a church with 
            contemporary music growing up. Our conversation centered around musical appreciation as well as the demographics of La 
            Jolla Presbyterian. The big-ticket item we discussed: “How do you share organ music with others?”</p>

        <p>At La Jolla Presbyterian, the congregation is generally older and prefers traditional music. Additionally, many 
            congregation members are retired professional musicians and are actively engaged with the organ. Jenny explained 
            that the congregation members are ready to take action with any feedback or ideas she has, as well as make 
            suggestions of their own, arrange pieces for her, and invite her to play in small groups outside of church.</p>

        <p>How does this relate back to our question? The key is exposure and appreciation. As we consider how organ music is shared, 
            we must consider where people encounter it. The organ is not a portable instrument, so listeners must go out of their way 
            to places where organs are housed. In San Diego, that means attending a church, theater, or stadium.</p>

        <p>In the context of La Jolla Presbyterian, the congregation at La Jolla Presbyterian values their organ, whether that be 
            because many of them are musicians, because they grew up in traditional churches which made use of the organ, or various 
            other reasons. Considering other places of worship in San Diego, there is a broad range from classical services with 
            choirs and organs, to small praise bands or solo instrumentalists, to full bands at mega churches. Then, it follows to 
            ask where and how are the younger generations encountering organ music? Through investigating the other organs in San Diego, 
            we can answer this question more thoroughly. </p>

        <h1 id="first-unitarian"></h1>

        <h2>First Unitarian Universalist Church</h2>
    
        <p>In middle school, I had the opportunity to play the FUU organ in the Southern California Junior Bach Festival.</p>
    
        <p>First Unitarian Universalist church is located at 298 W Arbor Dr., San Diego, California. This is in San Diego’s 
            Hillcrest neighborhood, which is considered an LGBTQ+ hub and is home to the annual pride parade and the largest 
            concentration of LGBTQ-owned businesses in the city. This is key to the identity of the staff and congregation at 
            FUU, as they pride themselves on inclusivity, supporting people of various beliefs, ages, backgrounds, and 
            identities. <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/citycouncil/cd3/communities/hillcrest" target="_blank">Hillcrest</a></p>

        <p>The organ at FUU is located at the front right of the sanctuary. The organist sits with their back to a wall of 
            floor to ceiling windows while the pipes are positioned to their right. The sanctuary is a semi-circle and slopes 
            downwards, positioned on the crest of a hill. The organ at FUU was originally installed by Abbott and Sieker in 
            1969. In 2002, resident organist Ken Herman contacted Marceau & Associates to update the instrument. The project 
            included a new console, façade, and tonal additions while attempting to preserve the tonal and mechanical designs 
            of the original builders. <a href="https://www.thediapason.com/new-organs-77" target="_blank">Diapason</a></p>

        <p>I met with Tómas Acosta, the organist at FUU on Sunday, January 5th, 2025. Tomas serves as the choral director as 
            well as pianist for the church and occasionally plays hymns on the organ. He does not strongly identify as an 
            organist, and just recently began lessons with the past music director and organist, Ken Herman. Tomas told me 
            that the congregation at FUU thinks very highly of their organ and wished so badly to hear it played that they 
            started a fund to pay for him to take lessons, which he began a year ago. </p>

        <p>The organ at FUU is in need of care. The large glass window to the organ’s right lets sunlight in and warms up 
            the pipes, causing them to tend sharp. The stops at the console need new emblems as some of them have begun to 
            fade. Stepping back from the organ and thinking about the entire church building, FUU is located next to UCSD 
            Hillcrest Medical Campus, and as UCSD continues to grow their property, it is uncertain how this will affect the 
            future of FUU. </p>

        <p>Shifting gears to consider the space and those who use it, the community at FUU is what sets it apart from the 
            other locations I visited. There is a strong sense of community, and the members of the congregation are 
            welcoming to people of all identities. The congregation is mostly older, but there are many young children at 
            the services as well. In addition to solo music from Tomas, FUU is home to four different choirs: Chalice 
            Choir-a mixed community choir, Women’s choir, JUUL Tones-an acapella group, and South Bay Singers-a multicultural, 
            multigenerational group who performs more eccentric, modern tunes. It is also key to note that when singing hymns 
            and other worship songs, FUU alternates versus of English and Spanish. </p>

        <p>The next organ we will explore serves another congregation where diversity and culture thrive. Like FUU, the 
            Immaculata serves people from diverse backgrounds, and services include singing in English, Latin and Spanish. </p>

        <h1 id="immaculata">Immaculata</h1>

        <p>Growing up, I would see the towers of the Immaculata in the distance when driving by or playing tennis, 
            and I would occasionally visit USD’s campus where the church is located, although I had never been inside 
            the Immaculata before this visit.</p>

        <p>The Immaculata is located on University of San Diego’s campus at 5998 Alcala Park Way, San Diego, California. 
            It is not owned by the college, yet it does serve both students and community members.</p>

        <p>The sanctuary at the Immaculata is in the shape of a cross, with soaring rounded arched ceilings typical of 
            Catholic churches. The organ console and pipes are all located in the back balcony of the church. The organ 
            at the Immaculata is a 1973 Rudolf von Beckerath tracker organ, originally built for Mission San Luis Rey 
            Church before being moved to the Immaculata.</p>

        <p>I visited with the Immaculata’s current organist, Guadalupe Rios, on Tuesday, January 7th, 2025. Lupe 
            identifies as a pianist, composer, and choral director. Before studying music in college, he had no 
            professional training but quickly picked up necessary skills such as reading sheet music in music theory 
            courses. Lupe does not identify as a trained organist, but as I learned more about him and the Immaculata, 
            I realized this likely plays to his advantage in a variety of ways.</p>

        <p>As the organist at the Immaculata, Lupe is responsible for multiple masses throughout the day. The first mass 
            of the day is more traditional and services an older generation, while the services become more contemporary, 
            with a younger crowd as the day goes on. What effect does this have on the music Lupe selects? He shared with 
            me that the older generation enjoyed traditional organ tunes, while the younger generation preferred more 
            modern, contemporary music, thus the music shifts throughout the day. In the more contemporary services, Lupe 
            directs diverse ensembles including piano as well as a rhythm section with a full drumkit. Regardless of the 
            service, the Immaculata serves people from a variety of cultures, and they sing pieces in English, Latin, and 
            Spanish. Between the range of instrumentation and the cultural elements, this is where Lupe’s musical background 
            shines, as he can bring in his culture to perform his own arrangements and improvisations.</p>

        <p>Lupe described to me that in Catholicism, those who attend church should focus their attention on the message. 
            This doesn’t mean that the music isn’t important, as it helps progress the service, but a congregation member’s
             attention should be on worshipping God. This can be seen as Lupe is hidden from view in the balcony at the back 
             of the church. When at the console, his view is completely blocked by the pipes, so he must make use of screens 
             to time his entrances. </p>

        <p>Shifting focus to the organ, the first thing one notices is that while it is large, it is still too small for the 
            Immaculata. The church forms the shape of a cross, with the sanctuary at the intersection point and pews extending 
            in all four directions. Lupe estimated that the organ is about a third of the size it should be to fill the space. 
            As I walked out to the sanctuary, the sound was weak even on full organ. The organ is a two manual, mechanical 
            action with no pistons. As the church is quite deep and tall and the floors are marble, the reverberation was very
            long. It became very apparent listening to the organ how crucial it was to time registration changes precisely 
            while the sound decayed. </p>

        <p>Organists Jared Jacobsen and Alison Luedecke describe the effect of the move. 
            “Unfortunately, that’s what happened at the Immaculata, where we find a transplant with a story: we used to hear 
            its modestly sized, exquisitely beautiful von Beckerath organ in what Jared Jacobsen calls perfect, jewel-box 
            acoustics at the Mission San Luis Rey; now we try to hear it in the acoustically tiled, cavernous Immaculata. 
            Because it doesn’t reach the altar from the loft, the priest would ask the organist to play a little louder, when 
            she (now he) was playing as loud as she could or ought to. Alison Luedecke, the previous resident organist there, 
            tells me that the Immaculata action (the term for what connects pipes to keys) isn’t good and needs redoing: too 
            many compromises were made when the church installed an organ that was too small for the house.” 
            https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/1998/apr/09/cover-then-gabriel-said-the-pipe-organs-of-san-di/ 
            “Pipe Organ Database” 
            </p>

        <p>The Immaculata demonstrates the role of the organ in Catholic churches: the music is not the main part of mass, 
            God is.  The organist is hidden and placed at the back of the church. When the musician plays the piano in the 
            sanctuary, some members of the congregation are offended.</p>

        <p>Rios has received comments that some members of his congregation prefer his arrangements and playing on the organ 
            even though it veers from a that of a classically trained organist: members of the church grow up with traditional 
            hymn tunes, but those who are newer to the church may find traditional music more bland that that which uses the 
            organ as a medium to bring in other cultures and excitement -> this could be a good way to share the organ, social 
            media influencers also help this mission.</p>

        <p>There is a push and pull as the Catholic church focuses on the message and mission towards God and not the music, 
            but at the same time a musician wants to be recognized and appreciated for the work they are putting in (should 
            people clap after the postlude of a service?) </p>
